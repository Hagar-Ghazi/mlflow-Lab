  Vector Machine (SVM) with an RBF kernel. \nThis model was selected to capture non-linear
  relationships between features like Age, Balance, and Credit Score. \nIt includes
  probability estimation to allow for flexible thresholding during churn risk assessment.
  Performance metrics were calculated on a balanced test set."
