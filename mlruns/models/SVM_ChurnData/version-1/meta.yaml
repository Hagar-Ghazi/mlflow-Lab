description: "Version 1 of the bank consumer churn prediction model using a Support
  Vector Machine (SVM) with an RBF kernel.\nThis model was selected to capture non-linear
  relationships between features like Age, Balance, and Credit Score. \nIt includes
  probability estimation to allow for flexible thresholding during churn risk assessment.\nPerformance
  metrics were calculated on a balanced test set"
