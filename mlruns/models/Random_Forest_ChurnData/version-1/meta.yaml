description: "Version 1 of the bank consumer churn prediction model using a Random
  Forest Classifier. \nThis version includes tuned hyperparameters (n_estimators =
  100, max_depth = 10) and was trained on a balanced dataset using downsampling. \nIt
  achieved a balanced trade-off between precision and recall, making it suitable for
  identifying high-risk customers."
